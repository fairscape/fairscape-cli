# fairscape-cli
----------------
A utility for packaging objects and validating metadata for FAIRSCAPE.

## Features

fairscape-cli provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows the client side to create:

* [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) - a light-weight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. The CLI allows users to:
    * Create Research Object Crates (RO-Crates)
    * Add (transfer) digital objects to the RO-Crate
    * Register metadata of the objects
    * Describe schema of dataset objects (CSV, TSV) as metadata and perform shallow validation.
