Datasets may be subject to access restrictions.","root['@id'], root['identifier'] (for DOI)",Directly Mapped. Check for the presence of a resolvable ARK and/or DOI.
0,FAIRness,0.b,Accessible,"Descriptive metadata should always be available and accessible, even if the dataset is restricted, unavailable, or de- accessioned. Ensure metadata conforms to standards like DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary) or schema.org.","Default Statement: ""The RO-Crate's JSON-LD metadata is machine-readable and publicly accessible by design.""","Inferred. Accessibility in FAIR refers to the metadata, which is always public for an RO-Crate."

The use of common, standard formats (RO-Crate, schema.org, Croissant) is the evidence."
0,FAIRness,0.d,Reusable,"Attach a clear and accessible data usage license that allows the responsible use of AI/ML applications. Alternatively, for restricted datasets, define a Data Use Agreement (DUA) and provide a means for automated acknowledgment and tracking of this agreement by data users.",root['license'],Directly Mapped. The license is the key indicator of reusability. Versioning also supports it.
1,Provenance,1.a,Transparent,"Identify sources of data back to reasonable ground-truth, e.g. clinical data from EHR at a given hospital, clinical trials, or laboratory data.","Logic: Count all top-level `Dataset` entities that are not generated by a `Computation` or `Experiment` within the crate. Report the count and types (e.g., '5 KOLF cell line samples').",Inferred. Transparency is shown by clearly identifying the initial inputs to the research object. This requires custom logic to find root nodes in the internal provenance graph.

The structure of the RO-Crate itself provides the semantic context.
2,Characterization,2.b,Statistics,"Provide appropriate statistical characterizations of key features of the dataset (e.g. demographics) where appropriate, to assist in planning analyses. Ensure missing values are encoded consistently.","Logic: Count `Dataset` entities that have a `hasSummaryStatistics` property. Report both (e.g., 'Total size: 19.1 TB. Summary statistics files available for 3 datasets').",Inferred. Provides a high-level overview of data volume and the availability of deeper statistical analysis.
2,Characterization,2.c,Standards,"Provide a machine-readable data dictionary or schema for each dataset, linked to the dataset metadata, and referencing any important applicable standards.","Default Statement: ""This dataset adheres to the RO-Crate 1.2 and Croissant RAI 1.0 community standards.""",Inferred. Adherence to these standards is the evidence.
2,Characterization,2.d,Potential Sources of Bias,"Describe known sources of bias in the data and assumptions made in collecting, processing, or interpreting the data. Include any known explanations regarding missing values, including methodological reasons for missingness, as well as the degree to which the data represents a state of interest vs. a control (e.g., disease state vs. healthy state).",rai:dataBiases (from --potential-sources-of-bias),Directly Mapped. Pull the user-provided statement on bias.
2,Characterization,2.e,Data Quality,"Have quality control procedures been applied? If so, provide a link to a description.",N/A,Gap/TODO. Will require a new dedicated metadata field for a data quality statement.
3,Pre-Model Explainability,3.a,Data Documentation Template,Machine-readable metadata and/or a linked human-readable document should support a domain-appropriate subset of the information in Datasheets94 or Healthsheets95. Reference the specific information items supplied for this dataset.,"Default Statement: ""Documentation is provided via the RO-Crate's structured JSON-LD metadata, this HTML Datasheet, and Croissant RAI properties.""",Inferred. The collection of documentation artifacts fulfills this criterion.
3,Pre-Model Explainability,3.b,Fit for Purpose,Identify appropriate and inappropriate use cases for a given data set in AI applications. Link to any previously published analyses using this data.,"rai:dataUseCases, rai:dataLimitations",Directly Mapped. These fields are designed exactly for this purpose.
3,Pre-Model Explainability,3.c,Verifiable,"Provide a mechanism for ensuring the integrity of each raw or processed dataset, such as a checksum.",Logic: Calculate the percentage of `Dataset` and `Software` entities that have an `md5` property.,Inferred. Report the percentage of files with verifiable checksums.
4,Ethics,4.a,Ethically Acquired,"Describe ethical data acquisition consistent with accepted principles (i.e. Belmont ReportPrinciples 64,65, sufficient for its proper evaluation in context of intended use, along with a management plan.","rai:dataCollection, human-subject",Directly Mapped (RAI). The `dataCollection` narrative provides the primary evidence.
4,Ethics,4.b,Ethically Managed,"Data management, including processing, storage and access and use are expected to align with ethical principles throughout the health AI lifecycle. Indicate privacy-protection processing, if any, sufficient to evaluate ethical status for intended use","root['additionalProperty'] where name is ""Data Governance Committee"", ethicalReview",Inferred. Pull the name of the governance committee and the contact for ethical review as evidence.
4,Ethics,4.c,Ethically Disseminated,"Specify a licensing agreement and/or data use agreement (DUA), or contact information to establish a DUA, on as open terms as ethical and sustainability considerations permit. Specify contact information for a data access committee, if needed to review requests for controlled data.","root['license'], prohibited-uses, rai:personalSensitiveInformation","Directly Mapped. The license, prohibited uses, and documentation of sensitive info are direct evidence."
4,Ethics,4.d,Secure,Specify security requirements for storing and accessing this data,root['confidentialityLevel'],Directly Mapped. This field indicates the security posture.
5,Sustainability,5.a,Persistent,"Ensure that unprocessed data is preserved in an archive adhering to privacy laws and retention guidelines, enabling future reprocessing and updated publishing of revised data.","root['@id'], root['identifier'] (DOI)",Directly Mapped. Evidence is the use of persistent identifiers.
5,Sustainability,5.b,Domain-appropriate,Ensure single domain raw or processed data (as appropriate) is deposited in a FAIR domain-appropriate specialist repository if available,maintenance-plan (from rai:dataReleaseMaintenancePlan),Directly Mapped. Replaced original sub-criterion with the more concrete `maintenance-plan` property to fulfill the spirit of long-term planning.
