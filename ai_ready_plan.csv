0,FAIRness,0.a,Findable,"root['@id'], root['identifier'] (for DOI)","Directly Mapped. Check for the presence of a resolvable ARK and/or DOI."
0,FAIRness,0.b,Accessible,"Default Statement: ""The RO-Crate's JSON-LD metadata is machine-readable and publicly accessible by design.""","Inferred. Accessibility in FAIR refers to the metadata, which is always public for an RO-Crate."
0,FAIRness,0.c,Interoperable,"Default Statement: ""The dataset uses the schema.org vocabulary within the RO-Crate framework and conforms to the Croissant RAI specification for interoperability.""","Inferred. The use of common, standard formats (RO-Crate, schema.org, Croissant) is the evidence."
0,FAIRness,0.d,Reusable,"root['license'], root['version']","Directly Mapped. The license is the key indicator of reusability. Versioning also supports it."
1,Provenance,1.a,Transparent,"Logic: Count all top-level `Dataset` entities that are not generated by a `Computation` or `Experiment` within the crate. Report the count and types (e.g., '5 KOLF cell line samples').","Inferred. Transparency is shown by clearly identifying the initial inputs to the research object. This requires custom logic to find root nodes in the internal provenance graph."
1,Provenance,1.b,Traceable,"Logic: Count all `Computation` and `Experiment` entities within the crate. Report the total count (e.g., '50 data transformation steps documented').","Inferred. Traceability is shown by the number of documented transformation steps (computations/experiments) that occurred."
1,Provenance,1.c,Interpretable,"Logic: Count all unique `Software` entities linked from `Computation` or `Experiment` entities. Report the count and formats (e.g., '3 software instances documented (.py, .sh)').","Inferred. Interpretability is demonstrated by linking to the software used. This is a high-level count."
1,Provenance,1.d,Key Actors Identified,"root['author'], root['publisher'], root['principalInvestigator']","Directly Mapped. These fields directly identify the key people and organizations."
2,Characterization,2.a,Semantics,"Default Statement: ""Data is semantically described using the schema.org vocabulary within a machine-readable RO-Crate.""","Inferred. The structure of the RO-Crate itself provides the semantic context."
2,Characterization,2.b,Statistics,"Logic: Sum `contentSize` from all `Dataset` entities. Count `Dataset` entities that have a `hasSummaryStatistics` property. Report both (e.g., 'Total size: 19.1 TB. Summary statistics files available for 3 datasets').","Inferred. Provides a high-level overview of data volume and the availability of deeper statistical analysis."
2,Characterization,2.c,Standards,"Default Statement: ""This dataset adheres to the RO-Crate 1.2 and Croissant RAI 1.0 community standards.""","Inferred. Adherence to these standards is the evidence."
2,Characterization,2.d,Potential Sources of Bias,"rai:dataBiases (from --potential-sources-of-bias)","Directly Mapped. Pull the user-provided statement on bias."
2,Characterization,2.e,Data Quality,"N/A","Gap/TODO. Will require a new dedicated metadata field for a data quality statement."
3,Pre-Model Explainability,3.a,Data Documentation Template,"Default Statement: ""Documentation is provided via the RO-Crate's structured JSON-LD metadata, this HTML Datasheet, and Croissant RAI properties.""","Inferred. The collection of documentation artifacts fulfills this criterion."
3,Pre-Model Explainability,3.b,Fit for Purpose,"rai:dataUseCases, rai:dataLimitations","Directly Mapped. These fields are designed exactly for this purpose."
3,Pre-Model Explainability,3.c,Verifiable,"Logic: Calculate the percentage of `Dataset` and `Software` entities that have an `md5` property.","Inferred. Report the percentage of files with verifiable checksums."
4,Ethics,4.a,Ethically Acquired,"rai:dataCollection, human-subject","Directly Mapped (RAI). The `dataCollection` narrative provides the primary evidence."
4,Ethics,4.b,Ethically Managed,"root['additionalProperty'] where name is ""Data Governance Committee"", ethicalReview","Inferred. Pull the name of the governance committee and the contact for ethical review as evidence."
4,Ethics,4.c,Ethically Disseminated,"root['license'], prohibited-uses, rai:personalSensitiveInformation","Directly Mapped. The license, prohibited uses, and documentation of sensitive info are direct evidence."
4,Ethics,4.d,Secure,"root['confidentialityLevel']","Directly Mapped. This field indicates the security posture."
5,Sustainability,5.a,Persistent,"root['@id'], root['identifier'] (DOI)","Directly Mapped. Evidence is the use of persistent identifiers."
5,Sustainability,5.b,Domain-appropriate (Replaced),"maintenance-plan (from rai:dataReleaseMaintenancePlan)","Directly Mapped. Replaced original sub-criterion with the more concrete `maintenance-plan` property to fulfill the spirit of long-term planning."
5,Sustainability,5.c,Well-governed,"root['additionalProperty'] where name is ""Data Governance Committee""","Inferred. Evidence of a named governance body."
5,Sustainability,5.d,Associated,"Default Statement: ""All data, software, and computations are explicitly linked within the RO-Crate's provenance graph.""","Inferred. The nature of a well-formed RO-Crate is that its components are associated."
6,Computability,6.a,Standardized,"Logic: List all unique `format` values from `Dataset` and `Software` entities.","Inferred. Provides a summary of the standardized file formats used in the crate."
6,Computability,6.b,Computationally Accessible,"Default Statement: ""Data is hosted in public repositories (e.g., NCBI, MassIVE, Dataverse) that support programmatic access.""","Inferred. Assumes the publisher is a repository with an API, which is standard for FAIR data."
6,Computability,6.c,Portable,"Default Statement: ""The dataset is packaged as a self-contained RO-Crate, a standard designed for portability across systems.""","Inferred. The use of the RO-Crate standard itself is the evidence for portability."
6,Computability,6.d,Contextualized,"Default Statement: ""Context is provided by the RO-Crate's graph structure and detailed in properties such as `rai:dataLimitations`.""","Inferred. The combination of the graph's structure and specific metadata fields provides context."
